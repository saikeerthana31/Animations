-> This is an HTML and CSS animation of multiple neon-green circles dynamically floating in 3D space. 
-> Each circle is of a different size, with a smooth up-and-down animation that is quite mesmerizing.
-> The animation is enhanced by hue-rotation and glowing effects, giving it a futuristic, sci-fi look. The circles seem to move in a synchronized yet staggered manner, producing a visually appealing wave-like motion against a dark background.

# Animation-2 folder:

-> This Python Turtle graphics script produces a beautiful spiral pattern with alternating white and orange colours on a black background. 
-> The animation is achieved by using loops to dynamically rotate and draw circles while moving forward and backward, creating an intricate swirling effect. 
-> With tracer(10), the drawing speed is optimized for smoother rendering. The combination of circular arcs and movement results in a visually appealing, hypnotic design.
