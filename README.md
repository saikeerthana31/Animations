This is an HTML and CSS animation of multiple neon-green circles dynamically floating in 3D space. Each circle is of a different size, with a smooth up-and-down animation that is quite mesmerizing. The animation is enhanced by hue-rotation and glowing effects, giving it a futuristic, sci-fi look. The circles seem to move in a synchronized yet staggered manner, producing a visually appealing wave-like motion against a dark background.
