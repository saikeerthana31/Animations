# Animantion-1
 
This HTML and CSS animation shows a set of multiple neon-green circles floating dynamically in a 3D space. 
Each circle has different sizes, with the up-and-down movement creating an enthralling effect. 
It's further animated with hue-rotation and glowing effects to create a futuristic and sci-fi appearance. The circles move in a synchronized but staggered motion, giving an aesthetically pleasing wave-like impact against the dark background.
